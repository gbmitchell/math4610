**Routine Name:**           smaceps

**Author:** Gary Mitchell

**Language:** C. The code can be compiled using the Microsoft Visual C compiler.

For example,

    smaceps.c

will produce an executable **./smaceps.exe** than can be executed.

**Description/Purpose:** This routine will compute the single precision value for the machine epsilon or the number of digits
in the representation of real numbers in single precision. This is a routine for analyzing the behavior of any computer. This
usually will need to be run one time for each computer.

**Input:** There are no inputs needed in this case. Even though there are arguments supplied, the real purpose is to
return values in those variables.

**Output:** This routine returns a single precision value for the number of decimal digits that can be represented on the
computer being queried.

**Usage/Example:**

The routine has two arguments needed to return the values of the precision in terms of the smallest number that can be
represented. Since the code is written in terms of a Fortran subroutine, the values of the machine machine epsilon and
the power of two that gives the machine epsilon. Due to implicit Fortran typing, the first argument is a single precision
value and the second is an integer.

      call smaceps(sval, ipow)
      print *, ipow, sval

Output from the lines above:

      24   5.96046448E-08

The first value (24) is the number of binary digits that define the machine epsilon and the second is related to the
decimal version of the same value. The number of decimal digits that can be represented is roughly eight (E-08 on the
end of the second value).

**Implementation/Code:** The following is the code for smaceps()

      subroutine smaceps(seps, ipow)
    c
    c set up storage for the algorithm
    c --------------------------------
    c
          real seps, one, appone
    c
    c initialize variables to compute the machine value near 1.0
    c ----------------------------------------------------------
    c
          one = 1.0
          seps = 1.0
          appone = one + seps
    c
    c loop, dividing by 2 each time to determine when the difference between one and
    c the approximation is zero in single precision
    c --------------------------------------------- 
    c
          ipow = 0
          do 1 i=1,1000
             ipow = ipow + 1
    c
    c update the perturbation and compute the approximation to one
    c ------------------------------------------------------------
    c
            seps = seps / 2
            appone = one + seps
    c
    c do the comparison and if small enough, break out of the loop and return
    c control to the calling code
    c ---------------------------
    c
            if(abs(appone-one) .eq. 0.0) return
    c
        1 continue
    c
    c if the code gets to this point, there is a bit of trouble
    c ---------------------------------------------------------
    c
          print *,"The loop limit has been exceeded"
    c
    c done
    c ----
    c
          return
    end
